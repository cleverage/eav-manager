CleverAge/EAVManager
===========

# What's inside?
The "EAV Manager" or "Clever Data Manager" (CDM) is an extensive set of tools designed to build business-oriented data
repositories in Symfony.

It consists of several bundles put together to speed-up data modeling, data transformation and user interface
development.

## Philosophy
The CDM was designed using the same philosophy than the Symfony framework, using many small independent "bricks" that
provide simple but easily extendable features.

We didn't want to create a full-stack solution with a huge coupling between its components but instead focus on keeping
things simple and reusable.

You can still use the CDM "bare" without any additional development but don't expect any fancy configurable feature.
