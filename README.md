# What's inside?

The "EAV Manager" or "Clever Data Manager" (CDM) is an extensive set of tools designed to build business-oriented data
repositories in Symfony.

It consists of several bundles put together to speed-up data modeling, data transformation and user interface
development.

## Philosophy

The CDM was designed using the same philosophy than the Symfony framework, using many small independent "bricks" that
provide simple but easily extendable features.

We didn't want to create a full-stack solution with a huge coupling between its components but instead focus on keeping
things simple and reusable.

## Installation

Either use the [EAVManager starter kit](https://github.com/cleverage/eav-manager-starter-kit) or follow these steps:

 - [How to install this bundle manually](Documentation/A-01-install.md)

## Components

To understand the various configurations needed in order to create a full-scale application using this bundle, you need
to take a look at the inner components under the hood:
